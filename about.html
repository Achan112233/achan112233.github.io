        <h1>Hi, I'm Anthony Chan. I am a driven and curious individual with a strong foundation in computer science,
            currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My academic journey,
            complemented by hands-on internships and research, has fueled my passion for exploring the intersection of
            technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I have honed my skills in programming, user experience design,
            and software development, contributing to interesting and impactful projects. </h1>
        <h1>Beyond academics, I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology to drive meaningful change. Whether
            it's crafting intuitive user interfaces, building scalable applications, or pushing the boundaries of AI
            research, I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. In the long term, I aspire to contribute
            to advancements in artificial intelligence and large language models, enhancing their capabilities to solve
            real-world problems. Outside of coding, I enjoy engaging with hobbies such as PC building, Cooking, and
            Music which is a big part that makes me who I am</h1>
