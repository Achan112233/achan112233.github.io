        <h1>Hi, I'm Anthony Chan. I am a driven and curious individual with a strong foundation in computer science,
            currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My academic journey,
            complemented by hands-on internships and research, has fueled my passion for exploring the intersection of
            technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I have honed my skills in programming, user experience design,
            and software development, contributing to interesting and impactful projects. </h1>
        <h1>Beyond academics, I am deeply driven by a passion for harnessing technology to create meaningful impact.
            Whether designing intuitive user interfaces or developing scalable applications, I aim to contribute to
            advancements in artificial intelligence and large language models, pushing their capabilities to solve
            real-world challenges. Outside of coding, I find joy in hobbies that reflect my creative and technical
            interests, such as PC building, cooking, and exploring the world of musicâ€”each of which plays a significant
            role in shaping who I am and inspiring my work.</h1>
