        A high-performance mock shell in C, was designed to replicate the functionality of a UNIX
        shell with added support for complex command execution. Leveraging multithreaded programming techniques, the
        shell efficiently
        managed concurrent command execution, improving performance by 25%. Advanced functionalities such as boolean
        operators, pipes, and input/output redirection were also implemented, enabling the handling of
        command sequences.
